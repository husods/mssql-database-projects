# Database Performance Optimization and Monitoring Project

## Objective
Analyze a large database to apply optimization techniques, improve query performance, and implement monitoring strategies.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
- T-SQL (Transact-SQL)

## Performed Steps

### 1. Query Performance Analysis
- Used Dynamic Management Views (DMV) to evaluate query performance.
- Identified queries with high logical reads, high CPU usage, and long execution times.

### 2. Query Optimization
- Rewrote inefficient queries to improve execution speed.
- Added missing indexes on critical columns used in WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY clauses.

### 3. Index Management
- Created new indexes to optimize data retrieval.
- Dropped unused or redundant indexes to free up resources.

### 4. Monitoring Setup
- Configured SQL Profiler to trace long-running queries and resource-heavy operations.
- Applied filters to monitor only critical performance events.

### 5. Access Control Adjustments
- Created roles and assigned specific database access permissions.
- Ensured that users only have the minimum necessary privileges.

## Conclusion
Database performance was successfully improved through query optimization and proper indexing.  
Continuous monitoring was established, and access control was tightened to enhance database security.
