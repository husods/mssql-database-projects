**Airbnb Open Data ETL Project Report**

---

# 1. Project Objective
Clean and prepare the "Airbnb_Open_Data" dataset for analytical and reporting purposes by applying a structured ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process.

---

# 2. Data Quality Assessment
- **Checked total records and NULL values** for important columns to assess data completeness.

---

# 3. Data Cleaning
### 3.1 Filling Missing Values
- Filled missing **categorical (text)** fields with default placeholders (e.g., 'Unknown', 'Not specified').
- Filled missing **numeric and boolean** fields with logical defaults (e.g., 0, 0.0).

### 3.2 Removing Invalid Records
- Deleted records where **latitude or longitude** values were missing.
- Removed listings with **minimum_nights > 366** as unrealistic.

### 3.3 Correcting Excel Errors
- Replaced **#NAME?** errors in `house_rules` with 'Not Provided'.

---

# 4. Duplicate Handling
- Detected duplicate records using all relevant fields.
- Retained only the first occurrence of each duplicate.

---

# 5. Data Reduction
- Dropped **license** column due to low availability.
- Dropped **country** and **country_code** columns since all records are from "United States".

---

# 6. Data Encoding
- Encoded `host_identity_verified` column into binary format (0/1) and renamed it to `host_verified_flag`.

  **(Resim önerisi: host_identity_verified distinct değer sorgusu sonucu)**

---

# 7. Feature Engineering
- Created `total_price` as the sum of `price` and `service_fee`.
- Categorized `price` into three segments: `cheap`, `medium`, and `expensive`.

  **(Resim önerisi: PERCENTILE_CONT hesaplama sonucu ve yeni price_category güncellemesi)**

---

# 8. Data Validation
- Corrected invalid values in `availability_365`, `minimum_nights`.
- Added the following constraints to ensure data integrity:
  - `availability_365` between 0 and 365
  - `review_rate_number` between 1 and 5
  - `price`, `service_fee`, `reviews_per_month` ≥ 0
  - `minimum_nights` ≥ 1

---

# 9. Final Data Load
- Loaded the cleaned and transformed data into a final table named **Airbnb_Cleaned_Final**.

  **(Resim önerisi: Airbnb_Cleaned_Final ilk 5 satır görüntüsü)**

---

# 10. Summary
The ETL process successfully:
- Improved data quality by handling missing, incorrect, and duplicate values.
- Reduced irrelevant columns.
- Engineered new features for better analytical insights.
- Applied strict validation rules to ensure consistency.

Ready for further data analysis or machine learning tasks.
